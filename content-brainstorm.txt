4. Office Hours
-----------------------
you know


3. Extra help:
What can you do...and in what order...
  1. figure it out yourself!  You should probably struggle with a topic for at least 45 minutes before deciding that you need help.  Learning is a struggle.
  2. office hrs.  go to instructor or TA office hours.  It is always good to write down the questions / topics you need help with ahead with, so you know what to ask.
  3. by appointment - ppl will do office hrs by appointment if reg. hours conflic w/ ur schedule.
  3. go to the learning cente
  4. get a tutor in math dept - This may cost money.
